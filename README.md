# Multi-stressor effects of ocean acidification, light reduction, and herbivory on Zostera marina in a low light system
Data visualization and analyses for Christian R. H. Tettelbach's and Katharyn E. Boyer's study titled "Multi-stressor effects of ocean acidification, light reduction, and herbivory on Zostera marina in a low light system."

Each main folder (i.e., "1_mesocosm", "2_feeding assay", etc) contains the necessary .csv file to run the R scripts in each sub-folder. Remember to set your working directory to the main folder before running the code in that folder, otherwise the file paths will not work.
